##Methodology 
In order to evaluate the performance of each algorithm in different scenarios the adjustment of parameters adopted were: the size of the array of words, and the maximum text width (M). 
Six arrays  were used, they were composed by words ranging in length 1 to 8 (see appendix 1) and the total number of words in each array were: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300. In addition, nine different Ms were used: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50. 
Therefore, for each M all the six arrays were  processed, generating for each algorithm a total of 54 outputs.
