# AdvancedAlgorithms


## Methodology 
In order to evaluate the performance of each algorithm in different scenarios, we varied the number of words in the input text and the maximum line width. We generated 10 different input strings, all composed by words which lengths followed an uniform distribution between 1 to 8 (so an average word length of 4.5 characters), and the total number of words in each text were: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150. In addition, five different maximum line widths were used: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Therefore, we had 50 different combinations of number of words and maximum width, and combining that with the three different text alignments (left, center and right), each algorithm was evaluated on 150 different scenarios.

For each algorithm, we evaluated the running time the memory consumption and the final value of the cost function.
